# Iphone Calculator Replication

For this calculator project by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator), we had to program a functional calculator from scratch. I first started by crafting the calculator and UI, then i dove into Javascript where i got stuck and had trouble getting the calculator to do actual calculations. Eventually i got it to work after tons of hours of looking up tutorials mixed with blood, sweat, and tears. Overall, this was a great learning experience to further my knowledge of Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
